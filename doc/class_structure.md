How to use np1sec library to secure your chat client MyInsecChatClient
======================================================================

You need to implement an interface file similar to

test/chat_mocker_np1sec_plugin.cc

in particular you should call:
- np1secUserState::Join when the user join a room.
- np1secUserState::leave_room when user intends to leave the room.

- np1secUserState::nincrement_room_size when somebody else join the room.
- np1secUserState::shrink when somebody leaves the room.

- np1secUserState::send_handler: when user wants to send a message to the room.
- np1secUserState::receive_handler: when a message is received by the room.

Also by setting following pointers you need to provide np1sec with suitable functionality:

- np1secAppOps::send_bare should send a text message (as is) to the room.
- np1secAppOps::join should update user ui about somebody joined the room.
- np1secAppOps::leave  should update user ui as somebody left the room.
- np1secAppOps::display_message should display a message in room ui.
- np1secAppOps::validate_long_term_key: should tell np1sec if a long term key belongs to a participant or not.
- np1secAppOps::set_timer: should set a one time timed callback.
- np1secAppOps::axe_timer: should disarm a previous set timer.


Class Structure
===============

## np1secUserState

represent an account corresponds to a user logged in the chat server it keeps
a list of rooms that user joins.

## np1secRoom

represent a room on the chat server and manage list of sessions on the room and
session room transition

## np1secSession

Represent a secure set of participants with a common encryption key. Each session keep a of list participants

## Participant

Represent each participant in the room. It store information about the participant: p2p key, public key for signature and authentication, etc.

## ChatMocker
Is a mock chat server and client, simulating a chat server by storing all messages sent to a room to a queue. It eventually deliver all messages to all participant in the room.


How does it work?
=================
When np1secUserState is signaled that the user is joined in the room, np1secRoom corresponds to that room get constructed, the user (if not alone in the room) sends its own ephemeral key and ask the participants in the room to join the room. Participants in the room initiate a new session in that room to include the joiner. If the np1sec protocol fininshes successfully a new active_session will be constructed and participants start using encrypting in the new session.

The same way when a user leave the room, a new session is generated by the paticipant to generate a new key to exclude the leaving user.

Each session also has a time span, when the time is up, all users generate a new session and when is constructed it is going to be replaced the current session.
